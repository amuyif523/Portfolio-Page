# Design Inspiration & Benchmarks

## 1. Active Theory
**Core Trait:** *Fluidity & Immersion*
- **Takeaway**: Transitions should never be abrupt. Every state change (page load, hover, click) must have a fluid, calculated ease.
- **Application**: Use GSAP for complex timelines. Ensure the site feels like a single continuous application, not a series of disjointed pages.

## 2. Bruno Simon
**Core Trait:** *Playful Interaction & Technical Mastery*
- **Takeaway**: Demonstrate technical depth through interaction. The user shouldn't just consume content; they should manipulate it.
- **Application**: Micro-interactions that respond to cursor velocity or scroll position. Physics-based feel where appropriate, but kept performant.

## 3. Lando Norris / Quadrant
**Core Trait:** *Modern Grid & Bold Typography*
- **Takeaway**: High energy meets strict structure. Strong use of typography as a graphical element.
- **Application**: Swiss-style grid layouts. Large, confident headings. High contrast. A "racing" aesthetic—fast, precise, and engineered.

## Synthesis
We are aiming for the **precision** of Lando Norris, the **fluidity** of Active Theory, and the **interactive depth** of Bruno Simon.
