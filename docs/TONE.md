# Tone & Voice Guidelines

## Tone Boundaries
- **Confident, not flashy**: Expertise is demonstrated through clarity and execution, not decorative noise.
- **Minimal, not empty**: Every element serves a purpose; negative space is intentional, not accidental.
- **Technical, not academic**: Accessible complexity. We explain *why* and *how* without getting lost in jargon.

## Anti-Patterns (What this site is NOT)
- **Not a resume**: It is a portfolio of work and thinking, not a chronological list of jobs.
- **Not a blog**: Content is curated and timeless, not a stream of consciousness.
- **Not a playground demo site**: Experiments are polished into products or case studies, not left as raw codepens.
